A 3x3 matrix can be represented by an array of arrays: an outer array containing three subarrays that each contain three elements. For example, the 3x3 matrix shown below:

1  5  8
4  7  2
3  9  6

is represented by the following array of arrays:

const matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6],
];

An array of arrays is sometimes called a "nested array" because each inner subarray is nested inside an outer array. It also may be called a "two-dimensional array"

To access an element in the matrix, you can use bracket notation twice (such as array[][]), and include both the row index and column index within the brackets. Given the above matrix, matrix[0][2] is 8, and matrix[2][1] is 9. An entire row in the matrix can be referenced using a single index: matrix[1] is the row (subarray) [4, 7, 2]. Furthermore, given a row, we can determine the total number of columns by counting the number of elements in the row. Unfortunately, a convenient notation for accessing an entire column does not exist.

The transpose of a 3x3 matrix is the matrix that results from exchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix. For example, the transposition of the matrix shown above is:

1  4  3
5  7  9
8  2  6

Write a function that takes an array of arrays that represents a 3x3 matrix and returns the transpose of the matrix. You should implement the function on your own, without using any external libraries.

Take care not to modify the original matrix â€” your function must produce a new matrix and leave the input matrix array unchanged.

Problem:
Return the transpose of a 3x3 matrix. 

Input: 3x3 matrix; an array of 3 arrays with three elements;
Output: the 3x3 matrix transposed

Definitions/Rules:
- 3x3 matrix: an array of 3 arrays with three elements each
- tranpose: rows become columns
  => matrix[0][0] => transpose[0][0];
  => matrix[0][1] => transpose[1][0];
  => matrix[0][2] => transpose[2][0];
  => matrix[1][0] => transpose[0][1];
  => matrix[m][n] => transpose[n][m];
- do not modify the original matrix

Examples / Test Cases:

const matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6]
];

const newMatrix = transpose(matrix);

console.log(newMatrix);      // [[1, 4, 3], [5, 7, 9], [8, 2, 6]]
console.log(matrix);         // [[1, 5, 8], [4, 7, 2], [3, 9, 6]]

Data Structure:
Input: an array of subarrays
Output: an array of subarrays transposed
Intermediate:
- ???

Algorithm:
- create a varible called transpose and assign it to an array containing three nested 
  arrays.
- perform a loop that contains a nested loop
- first loop will iterate over the rows;
- second loop will iterate over the columns;
- within the second loop use the following:
  - transpose[columnIndex][rowIndex] = matrix[rowIndex][columnIndex];
- after the loops complete, return the transpose

// Code

function transpose(matrix) {
  let transposed = [[], [], []];
  
  for (let row = 0; row <= 2; row += 1) {
    for (let column = 0; column <= 2; column += 1) {
      transposed[column][row] = matrix[row][column];
    }
  }
  
  return transposed;
}


const matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6],
];

const newMatrix = transpose(matrix);

console.log(newMatrix);
console.log(matrix);
